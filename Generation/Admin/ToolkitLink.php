 * the kernel runs in debug, and only when the theme is there; elsewhere

 *
 * The page is a story of the toolkit (SectionStories), declared only when

 * (a fork of Flexy from before them) answers the route but has no such page,
 * and reading SectionStories there would load an interface that does not
