/**
 * The tool that lets the generator writing a page make a component of the
 * site when the catalogue lacks one: a call of the generator of components
 * inside the call of the page, the component checked by the site, kept as a
 * prototype (in the catalogue for the pages that hold it, offered to nobody
 * else) and handed back as a sheet the model writes the page with.
 *
 * Not a GeneratorToolInterface, which every request is offered: the page
 * generator offers this one when the site allows it and the editor may make
 * components. Two components at most for one page; a page that needs more is
 * a catalogue to grow by hand.
 *
 * Stateful within one generation: the names made so far, which the page
 * generator adds to the enum of its output schema and `read_section` answers
 * for. Reset at the start of a generation and between requests.
