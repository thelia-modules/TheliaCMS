/**
 * The JSON schema of a document, built from the catalogue.
 *
 * Two readings of it. The full one says everything the props declare: the
 * shape of every section, its ranges and lengths; it is what the validator
 * enforces and what documents the catalogue. The strict one is what a
 * generator is constrained with, and it is deliberately small: the grammar
 * a structured output is compiled into cannot hold twenty sections with
 * their props (the API caps optional properties, union types and the size of
 * the grammar), so the generator is held to the envelope — a list of
 * sections, each naming a component of the catalogue and carrying its props
 * as a JSON object written as a string — and the validator reads the props
 * back and checks them against the full schema, sending the document back
 * for correction when they are wrong.
