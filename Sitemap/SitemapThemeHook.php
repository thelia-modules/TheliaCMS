/**
 * Adds the CMS pages to the sitemap of the theme.
 *
 * A theme opens its sitemap by calling `theme_hook('sitemap.urls')`, and any
 * module answers there. That is what a section registry would have been, minus
 * the registry: the theme decides where the entries go and the module decides
 * what they are.
 *
 * `lastmod` is the publication date, never the update date of the row. A row is
 * touched by things a reader never sees, and a sitemap that claims every page
 * changed last night is a sitemap a crawler learns to distrust.
 *
 * The answer is kept (`SitemapCache`), and a miss reads the pages once, with
 * their addresses, whatever their number.
