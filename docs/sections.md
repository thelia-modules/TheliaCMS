# Sections

A page of the CMS is a **document**: an ordered list of sections, each a
component of the catalogue with the values of its props. The document is what
is stored and edited; the HTML next to it in the database is its rendering,
produced when the page is saved and again when it is published.

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "sections": [
    {"id": "head", "component": "Layouts:Subheader:Base", "props": {"title": "Des studios photo à louer"}},
    {"id": "intro", "component": "cms:richtext", "props": {"html": "<p>Trois plateaux, à l’heure ou à la journée.</p>"}},
    {"id": "contact", "component": "Partial:cms-form", "props": {"form": 1}}
  ]
}
```

A section names a component by the name the catalogue knows it under, carries
an id of its own (lowercase letters, digits, hyphens and underscores) so a
later change can replace it alone, and holds props the component accepts. A
document whose sections name no component of the catalogue, or carry props a
component refuses, is rejected on the way in, every problem listed at once
(`TheliaCMS\Content\InvalidDocumentException`).

## The catalogue

`TheliaCMS\Content\SectionCatalog` holds every component a document may use:

| Family | Names | Where they come from |
|---|---|---|
| Free text | `cms:richtext` | The module. A piece of markup as is, filtered on the rendered page like everything that goes online. |
| Columns | `cms:columns` | The module. Two to four columns side by side, each an image (of the media library or an `https` address) over an optional heading and a short text, drawn with the grid of `blocks.css` and stacked below 48rem. |
| Image | `cms:image` | The module. One picture (of the media library or an `https` address) with an optional caption, at the width of the reading column (by default), of the content or of the whole screen; nothing is drawn while no image is chosen. |
| Live content | `Partial:<name>` | Every partial of the site (`PartialDefinitionInterface`), the ones of the module and the ones other modules register. The section renders the placeholder the partial renderer substitutes when the page is served. |
| Components of the theme | As the theme names them, `Molecules:Reinsurance:Base` | The components the active theme opens to pages in `config/theliacms.yaml` (below). |
| Components of the site | `Site:<Code>`, `Site:PricingPlans` | Made in the back office from a prompt and kept (**CMS > Components > New component**, or prototyped from the content screen of a page and kept for the whole site later): props as data, a sandboxed Twig template and a scoped stylesheet, stored in `cms_component` ([creating-a-component.md](creating-a-component.md#a-component-made-in-the-back-office)). |

A component of another module joins the catalogue by implementing
`TheliaCMS\Content\SectionDefinitionInterface`; implementing it is what
registers it. Several at once, decided at runtime, go through
`SectionProviderInterface`.

Two readings of it. `all()` is every component a stored document may name:
what renders and validates a page. `offered()` leaves out the components the
site switched off under **CMS > Components** (`SectionAvailability`) and the
prototypes (a component of the site made from a page and not kept for the
whole site yet, `SiteComponentSection::$prototype`): what the generator reads
and may write, and what the toolkit shows. A generation that
revises or translates a page is also allowed the components that page already
uses (`GenerationRequest::keptComponents()`), so a component switched off
never forces a page to change.

## Props

A component describes its props with `TheliaCMS\Content\Prop`, and the schema
(`PropSchema`) is what checks the values, describes them to whoever writes a
document, and becomes the JSON schema a generator is constrained with.

| Type | Holds | Checked |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | a line of plain text, printed escaped | length |
| `html` | markup, printed as is, filtered by the writer on the rendered page | that it is a string |
| `integer` | a whole number | range |
| `boolean` | true or false | |
| `choice` | one of a closed list | membership |
| `image` | the id of an image of the media library, `null` or `0` for none yet | a positive id |
| `url` | a path of the site, an absolute http(s), mailto or tel address | nothing else, `javascript:` first of all |
| `items` | a list of objects, each shaped by item props | count, and each item |
| `reference` | the id of an item of the site: a page, a menu, a form, a product | a positive id |
| `json` | a list or an object the component does not describe further | that it is one |

Unknown props are dropped, missing ones get their default, wrong ones are
refused.

## Appearance

Any section may carry an `appearance` next to its props, whatever its
component (`TheliaCMS\Content\SectionAppearance`):

```json
{"id": "selection", "component": "Layouts:CrossSelling:Base", "props": {"…": "…"}, "appearance": {"background": "#f8d7d7", "padding": "medium"}}
```

| Setting | Values | Style written |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| `background` | `#rrggbb` | `background-color` |
| `text` | `#rrggbb` | `color` |
| `padding` | `small`, `medium`, `large` | `padding-block` of 1.5, 3 or 5 rem |
| `align` | `left`, `center`, `right` | `text-align` |

Every setting is optional, and nothing else can be set: an unknown setting or
a value outside the list rejects the document like a wrong prop. A section
with an appearance renders inside a band of the whole width,
`<div class="cms-section-styled" data-cms-section="…" style="…">`, the
component unchanged inside it; a section without one renders, and is stored,
without it. The generator sets the appearance when a brief asks for a look in
words; "Edit by hand" sets it in its **Appearance** group, a colour typed or
picked. A translation takes the appearance of the source section by section:
it changes the words, not the look.

## Writing a section of your own

The first way is a component of the theme, opened in one line of
`config/theliacms.yaml` (below). A module that has to compute what it shows
writes a partial (`PartialDefinitionInterface`), or a class implementing
`SectionDefinitionInterface`:

```php
final readonly class OpeningHoursSection implements SectionDefinitionInterface
{
    public const string NAME = 'MyModule:OpeningHours';

    public function __construct(private Environment $twig) {}

    public function name(): string { return self::NAME; }
    public function label(): string { return 'Opening hours'; }

    public function description(): string
    {
        return 'The opening hours of the shop, one line per day. Use it on a contact or access page.';
    }

    public function schema(): PropSchema
    {
        return new PropSchema([
            Prop::text('title', 'Heading', required: true, max: 120),
            Prop::items('days', 'Days', [
                Prop::text('day', 'Day', required: true, max: 20),
                Prop::text('hours', 'Hours', required: true, max: 40),
            ], min: 1, max: 7),
        ]);
    }

    public function sample(): array
    {
        return ['title' => 'Opening hours', 'days' => [['day' => 'Monday', 'hours' => '9:00 – 18:00']]];
    }

    public function normalizeProps(array $props): array
    {
        return $this->schema()->normalize($props);
    }

    public function render(array $props, string $locale): string
    {
        return $this->twig->render('@MyModule/opening-hours.html.twig', ['props' => $props, 'locale' => $locale]);
    }
}
```

`description()` is read by a generator to pick the section: say what it is
for and when to use it. `sample()` is what the toolkit renders and the example
a generator is shown: realistic, complete, in the language of the back office.

## Opening the components of the theme

A theme built on Twig components (Flexy, or a child of it) opens some of them
to the pages of the CMS in `config/theliacms.yaml`:

```yaml
sections:
    components:
        - Molecules:Reinsurance:Base
        - Organisms:ArticleCard:Base
```

Nothing is opened by default: a cart line or a checkout step makes no sense on
a page, and the theme is the one that knows which components do. A child theme
inherits the list of its parent unless it declares its own.

The props of a component are read off its template: the `{# @prop name type
description #}` comments at the top give the type and the meaning, the
`{% props name = default, … %}` tag the defaults. A prop declared without a
default and not documented as nullable is required, and so is a record or a
picture the class of the component takes (documented, not declared) unless
its type says `|null`. A picture is stored as the id of the media library
and reaches the component as its address; a prop documented `html` is
markup, filtered by the writer on the rendered page. `camelCase` in the
template is `snake_case` in a document, and goes back to the component under
its own name. A `{# @description … #}` comment, when the template has one, is
what a generator reads about the component. Slots (`{% block %}`) are not
supported: a component whose content goes through a block cannot be filled
from a document.

The same file names the classes the theme styles written text with, which
free text sections (`cms:richtext`) then carry next to `cms-richtext`:

```yaml
sections:
    richtext_class: wysiwyg wysiwyg-theme
    components: []
```

Flexy styles its text with Tailwind Typography under the name `wysiwyg`:
without the class, its reset leaves the lists of a free text without bullets
or numbers and its headings the size of a paragraph. The class is written
when a page is rendered, at its save: a page saved before the theme named it
keeps its old rendering until it is saved or published again, or until
`thelia_cms:render` renders its draft again.

The same file may give a component the props the toolkit shows it with,
which the generator is shown and a section added by hand starts from:

```yaml
sections:
    examples:
        Layouts:Banner:Base:
            title: Fresh from the farm
            image: images/illustrations/banner.webp
```

A picture prop of an example may be the path of a file of the theme, written
as `asset()` takes it (relative, with no scheme and no leading slash). The
toolkit draws it from the address the theme serves it from, so the "All
sections" page shows real pictures. A document stores only the id of an image
of the media library or an https address: the generator and a section added
by hand never see the path and start with the picture empty. An id or an
https address given in an example is kept as it is. Pictures nested in a
`json` prop are not resolved.

A component that wires its behaviour with Stimulus (a carousel, tabs) keeps
it once published only if the theme names its controllers:

```yaml
sections:
    components:
        - Organisms:Carousel:Base
    controllers:
        - Organisms--Carousel--base
```

The filter a page goes through before it goes online drops every
`data-` attribute it does not know. For the controllers named here it keeps
`data-controller`, `data-action` and the `data-<identifier>-target`,
`-value`, `-param`, `-class` and `-outlet` attributes; in `data-controller`
and `data-action`, a controller the theme does not name is dropped, so that
written text cannot wire one the theme never opened to pages. Free text can
still use a controller named here, with values of its own: name only the
controllers that treat their values as data, never as markup or an address
to load. A page published before the theme named a controller is rendered
again by `thelia_cms:render`, then published.

## From a template

`cms_section(name, props)` renders a section anywhere in a theme, with its
sample props when none are given: `{{ cms_section('cms:richtext', {html: '…'}) }}`.
An unknown section renders nothing. It is also how the page of the toolkit of
the Flexy theme (`/toolkit/cms-all-sections`, in debug) shows every section.
