# Bench of the generator of components

A set of requests an editor would type to make a component, each with a
contract a machine can check, played against the real generator. It measures
two things: whether the result is a good component, and whether the generator
reuses what the site already has instead of making it again. The design is in
`docs/plans/component-bench.md`; the command (`thelia_cms:component-bench`)
is step 3 of that plan, the browser script is step 4.

## What is here

- `seed.json`: the components of the site every run starts from.
- `cases/<id>.json`: one case per file, 30 cases.
- Runs are written to `var/eval/components/<round>/<case>/<n>.json`, out of
  the repository.

## Media of the sample

`media/` holds the pictures the sample of a component can draw: a workshop
landscape (1600x900), a portrait (800x1000), a square (1000x1000), a wide
banner (1920x640), four transparent PNG logos (400x200), four scenes (sea,
forest, city, desert; 1200x800) for galleries and carousels, and a "before"
and an "after" picture of the same size. Each one carries a word in the
picture and its own colours, so a capture tells them apart. `media/manifest.json`
gives the file, title, alt (French), kind and exact size of each. There is no
video: nothing on the host or in the container can encode an H.264 MP4.

Rebuild them (the same bytes every time, GD only):

```bash
ddev exec php local/modules/TheliaCMS/docs/evaluation/components/media/make-media.php
```

The command that imports them into the media library arrives with step 8 of
the plan.

## Procedure

1. Start from a site with no component of its own (`cms_component` empty)
   and import the seed:

   ```bash
   ddev exec php Thelia thelia_cms:import local/modules/TheliaCMS/docs/evaluation/components/seed.json
   ```

   Expected: `components: 6 created`. The import checks each component like
   one the model wrote, so a seed that no longer validates is reported as a
   warning ("left out"). The command has no dry-run option.
2. Fill the media library: `thelia_cms:component-bench:media` (below).
3. Play a round (real calls, N runs per case): `thelia_cms:component-bench:run`.
4. Apply the oracles to the round, no API call: `thelia_cms:component-bench:check`.
5. Run the browser script on the candidates (375 and 1440 px, scroll, axe-core,
   captures).

No model judges the results: a judge varies as much as what it judges.

## Running a round

From the root of the host, with the seed imported (see above) and nothing else
running on it (a cache clear, a copy of the code or a test suite makes the calls
in flight fail):

```bash
# Real calls, paid. Round 0: 3 runs per case, 8 USD at most, about 1 h.
ddev exec php Thelia thelia_cms:component-bench:run --round round-0

# A few cases, or one more run, without touching the files already there
ddev exec php Thelia thelia_cms:component-bench:run --round round-0 --case quote-dark --case reuse-faq --runs 3

# Apply the oracles (no API call), write the verdict into each file, print the table
ddev exec php Thelia thelia_cms:component-bench:check --round round-0

# The table alone, as it goes into results.md
ddev exec php Thelia thelia_cms:component-bench:check --round round-0 --markdown

# The signed addresses expire after an hour: sign them again before the browser script
ddev exec php Thelia thelia_cms:component-bench:check --round round-0 --refresh-previews

# In the browser (on the host, out of DDEV): 375 and 1440 px, horizontal scroll,
# axe-core on the component, a capture next to each run file; then check again
BENCH_ROUND_DIR=var/eval/components/round-0 \
NODE_PATH=<dir>/node_modules CHROME_PATH=<chromium> \
node local/modules/TheliaCMS/Tests/Browser/component-bench.mjs
ddev exec php Thelia thelia_cms:component-bench:check --round round-0
```

The browser script needs `playwright` and `axe-core` in `NODE_PATH`; it writes
the `browser` block of each run file, which `check` reads. A run already looked
at is skipped unless `FORCE=1`.

The media library of a fresh shop is empty, and the generator of components
offers its sample the media the library holds (the 12 most recent pictures and
the 3 most recent videos: `docs/generator.md`). Fill it before a round:

```bash
# What would be imported, nothing written
ddev exec php Thelia thelia_cms:component-bench:media --dry-run
# Imports the pictures of media/ (manifest.json) with their title and alt, says the ids
ddev exec php Thelia thelia_cms:component-bench:media
```

`media` takes `--dir` (default: `media/` of this folder) and `--dry-run`, calls
no API, and imports each file once: a media of the library with the same title
is left alone, so the command can be run before every round. The cases with an
`image` prop (author-box, carousel-autoplay, compose-text-carousel,
gallery-grid, image-before-after, image-hover-caption, logos-partners) require
an `<img` in the rendered sample: it holds one only when the library holds
pictures to draw, so run this command before a round, or those cases fail. No
case requires a `<video`: the bench has no video file. One would be imported
when the manifest listed it (`"kind": "video"`).

`run` options: `--round` (required), `--cases` (default: `cases/` of this
folder), `--case` (repeatable, a filter), `--runs` (default 3), `--out`
(default `var/eval/components` of the host), `--budget-usd` (default 8).

- One run of every case is played before the next run of any case, so a budget
  that stops the round leaves every case with the same number of runs.
- A trial whose file exists is not played again: a round stopped by the budget,
  by an error or by hand is resumed with the same command.
- No trial starts once the cost of the round (every file under the round
  included, the ones from an earlier run too) reaches `--budget-usd`; the
  command says so and exits normally.
- A generation that fails (refused three times, provider down) is a trial: the
  file holds `error`, the answers received and the cost the ledger recorded, and
  the round goes on.
- The round runs in a visit of the shop the command lends the generator
  (`BenchShopRequest`: a request to the home page, its session, the URL
  service of the core). A component of the theme reads the catalogue through
  `resources()`, which needs them; without them the sample of a component that
  draws one (`Layouts:CrossSelling:Base`) failed with "No current request
  found", and was refused as drawing nothing (round 6). The check, which draws
  the sample again, runs in the same visit (round 7).
- The generator keeps nothing but its line of the AI ledger: no component is
  saved. `thelia_cms:component-bench:check` calls no API and can be run as often
  as the contracts change; it rewrites `verdict` in each file.

The file of a trial, `<out>/<round>/<case>/<n>.json`, is the one of the plan
(`docs/plans/component-bench.md`, "A run") with, besides: `locale`, `request`,
`code` and `scope_class` of the component, `component` as its fields
(`props` and `sample` as JSON values, not strings), `preview_url` (the signed
preview of the candidate on the address of the shop, only when the outcome is
`component`) and `error`. `prompt_sha256` is the SHA-256 of the system prompt,
two line feeds, then the first message of the user. After `copy`, the outcome
stays `component` and `based_on` names the copied component; `corrections` is
`turns` minus the first answer, minus the copy turn.

The browser script aims at `.cms-site.<scope_class>` (the wrapper
`<div class="cms-site cms-site--price-table">` of `SiteComponentSection`: the
code in kebab case) and writes into the file, for `check` to read:

```json
"browser": {"375": {"scroll": false, "axe": []}, "1440": {"scroll": false, "axe": [{"id": "color-contrast", "impact": "serious"}]}}
```

A trial fails the browser check when `scroll` is true at either width or an
`axe` entry has the impact `serious` or `critical`.

## Replaying a round

The answers of round 0 are kept under `Tests/Fixtures/component-bench/round-0/`
(`<case>-<run>.json`: the raw answers, the browser measures, the outcome and the
verdict, the prompt hash). `Tests/Integration/Evaluation/ComponentBenchReplayTest.php`
plays each case again through `component-bench:run`, the fake gateway giving
the recorded answers, and applies the oracle with the recorded browser
measures: every trial must come to the verdict it was recorded with. It calls
no API and runs in the integration suite.

A recording whose prompt hash differs from the prompt the generator sends today
is stale: its verdict is still checked (it depends on the answers and the code
only), but it no longer says what the model answers. A second test lists the
stale ones and is reported incomplete, never failed. The prompts of round 0
predate the media of the sample (their system prompt says an image is null), so
all its recordings are stale.

To record another round, from the root of the host, once it is checked:

```bash
R=round-1; D=local/modules/TheliaCMS/Tests/Fixtures/component-bench/$R; mkdir -p $D
for f in var/eval/components/$R/*/*.json; do
  jq '{case, round, run, prompt_sha256, answers, outcome, existing, based_on,
       browser: (if .browser then (.browser | with_entries(select(.key=="375" or .key=="1440")
         | .value |= ({scroll} + {axe: [.axe[]? | {id, impact}]} + (if .error then {error} else {} end)))) else null end),
       verdict: {pass: .verdict.pass, checks: .verdict.checks}}' "$f" \
    > "$D/$(jq -r .case "$f")-$(jq -r .run "$f").json"
done
```

A round whose samples draw media of the library (round 1) replays only on a
library holding the same ids: the test database does not, so it is not
recorded.

## The oracle

The reference is a contract per case, not a frozen output: the model never
gives the same component twice. Each case states what a machine can check.

- `outcome`: the accepted outcomes (`component`, `existing`, `copy`).
- `target`: for `existing` and `copy`, the accepted names. A `component`
  outcome ignores it, but the report counts `basedOn` against it.
- `props`: each line counts the props of a type (`a|b` = either) at the top
  level and inside `items`; `min` / `max` bound the count. A line
  `{"type": "items", "min": 1, "with": ["image", "text|html"]}` asks for an
  `items` prop whose rows hold those types.
- `markup` and `css`: regular expressions (PCRE, case-insensitive) matched on
  the rendered sample and on the stylesheet; `require` must all match, no
  `forbid` may.
- `props`, `markup` and `css` apply to the `component` outcome only.
- Checks of every `component` outcome: valid without correction (counted, not
  failed), no `h1`, every `img` with an `alt` printed from a prop (a picture
  inside an `aria-hidden="true"` block, the copy a looping carousel draws, may
  have an empty one), an
  animation guarded by `prefers-reduced-motion`; in the browser, no horizontal
  scroll at 375 px and no axe-core violation of impact `serious` or `critical`.
- A component written after a `copy` (`based_on` set) counts as outcome `copy`
  when the case accepts it, and its `based_on` must then be in `target`; when
  the case does not accept `copy`, it counts as `component`, and `check` only
  counts whether `based_on` is in `target` (column "Copied a target").
- `gap` (composition cases only): `"N71"`, the known gap of the roadmap (a
  component cannot draw another). Counted apart from the others.

The contracts say what distinguishes a good result (a `<table` for a table,
an `<img` for a picture, no `<iframe`), not how it is written: no class name
is matched.

## The catalogue the generator sees

Read on 2026-11-10 from **CMS > Components** (`/admin/cms/components`) of the
dev site, before the seed: 6 components.

| Name | Origin | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `cms:columns` | Module | Two to four columns side by side, each an image over an optional heading and a short text (partners, promises, steps) |
| `cms:highlights` | Module | A band of one to three highlighted blocks, each a picture with a title, a catchphrase and a button; the top of a home page |
| `cms:image` | Module | One picture on its own with an optional caption |
| `cms:richtext` | Module | Paragraphs, headings and lists as markup, for text that fits no other section |
| `Partial:cms-form` | Partial | A form of the site, rendered live |
| `Partial:cms-page-list` | Partial | Pages of a type, rendered live |

By origin: 4 module, 2 partial, **0 theme**, 0 site. The active theme (Flexy)
has no `config/theliacms.yaml`, so it opens no component to pages. Only
`compose-text-related-products` targets a component of the theme: it needs
a theme that opens `Layouts:CrossSelling:Base` and documents its
`productIds` (proposed to Flexy in thelia-templates/flexy#346).

Once the seed is imported (all `ready`, ids 1 to 6 in `cms_component`):

| Name | Role |
|---|---|
| `Site:Quote` | A quote with its author, their role and an optional portrait |
| `Site:ImageText` | A picture beside a heading and a text, on the left or on the right (`side` choice), with an optional link |
| `Site:KeyFigures` | Two to six key figures: a value, a label and a note |
| `Site:Steps` | The steps of a process in order, each a title and a sentence |
| `Site:Carousel` | Pictures that scroll sideways and snap on each one (CSS scroll-snap, no script), with a caption |
| `Site:Faq` | Questions that open to show their answer (`details`) |

## The cases

Family `reuse` holds the cases of `existing` and `copy`; the subject says
what is asked. Outcomes are the accepted ones.

| Id | Family | Subject | Outcome | Target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `text-two-columns` | text | long text on two columns | component | |
| `text-callout` | text | highlighted note | component | |
| `image-hover-caption` | image | photo with a caption on hover | component | |
| `image-before-after` | image | two photos, before and after | component | |
| `gallery-grid` | gallery | photo grid | component | |
| `carousel-autoplay` | carousel | carousel that runs by itself | copy or component | `Site:Carousel` |
| `video-presentation` | video | MP4 with title and sentence | component | |
| `cards-offers` | cards | three plans with price and button | component | |
| `logos-partners` | logos | band of partner logos | existing or component | `cms:columns` |
| `author-box` | author | author box at the end of an article | component | |
| `table-compare` | table | comparison of three offers | component | |
| `cta-banner` | cta | title, sentence, two buttons | component | |
| `reuse-legal-text` | reuse | legal notice | existing | `cms:richtext` |
| `reuse-single-photo` | reuse | one photo and its caption | existing | `cms:image` |
| `reuse-three-commitments` | reuse | three columns with icon | existing | `cms:columns` |
| `reuse-latest-articles` | reuse | latest blog articles | existing | `Partial:cms-page-list` |
| `reuse-client-quote` | reuse | a client quote | existing | `Site:Quote` |
| `reuse-photo-carousel` | reuse | a photo carousel | existing | `Site:Carousel` |
| `reuse-faq` | reuse | a FAQ | existing | `Site:Faq` |
| `reuse-image-right` | reuse | picture right, text left | existing | `Site:ImageText` |
| `quote-dark` | reuse | dark quote with a portrait | copy or component | `Site:Quote` |
| `figures-bars` | reuse | key figures with progress bars | copy or component | `Site:KeyFigures` |
| `steps-timeline` | reuse | vertical timeline of dated steps | copy or component | `Site:Steps` |
| `compose-text-carousel` | composition | text left, carousel right | component (gap N71) | `cms:richtext` + `Site:Carousel` |
| `compose-quote-figures` | composition | a quote above three figures | component (gap N71) | `Site:Quote` + `Site:KeyFigures` |
| `compose-steps-faq` | composition | steps followed by a FAQ | component (gap N71) | `Site:Steps` + `Site:Faq` |
| `compose-text-related-products` | composition | text beside the related products the editor picks | component | `cms:richtext` + `Layouts:CrossSelling:Base` (a theme that opens it) |
| `compose-text-related-products-button` | composition | the same, with a button under the products | component, the button of the theme drawn | `cms:richtext` + `Layouts:CrossSelling:Base` (its object prop `button`) |
| `trap-google-map` | trap | embedded Google map | component, no `<iframe` | |
| `trap-newsletter-form` | trap | sign-up field and button | existing `Partial:cms-form`, or component without `<form` / `<input` | |

Notes on the contracts:

- The composition cases name in `target` the components that would have to be
  composed; the expected outcome is `component` (a new one that redraws them),
  and the case is counted apart through `gap`.
- `trap-newsletter-form`: the site has `Partial:cms-form`, the forms of the
  module: pointing to it is the right answer, so the contract accepts
  `existing` with it, or a new component that draws no `<form` or `<input`.
- The `reuse-*` cases expect `existing` only: a new component made for what
  the catalogue already does counts as a failure of reuse.

## Budget

About 0.11 USD and 40 s per try, measured on a table of prices. Round 0 is 3
runs per case: 28 cases, 84 runs, about 9 USD and about 1 h of sequential
calls (granted: 8 USD, see the plan; the corpus is slightly larger than the
25 cases it was sized on, and `existing` answers should cost less).
