# Plan: pictures found on the web

Status: planned, not started. Two questions below are open and must be
settled before any code.

## Why

A brief that asks for a picture the media library does not hold, and gives no
address of one ("a photo of the tart out of the oven, found on the internet"),
gives a page without it. Since the `left_out` list (see `docs/generator.md`)
the editor is told so, but the generator still cannot find the picture.

## What is there today

- `cms:image` takes an image of the media library or the `https` address of
  a picture kept elsewhere (`Content/ImageSection.php`, `Content/ImageSource.php`).
- `search_media` lists the images of the library (`Generation/Tool/SearchMediaTool.php`).
- `web_fetch` is offered only when the brief cites an `http(s)` address
  (`Generation/PageGenerator.php`, `Generation/Brief.php::addresses()`), and
  its blocks are sent back as they are (`Generation/StreamedMessage.php`).
- The answer may say what it left out (`left_out`), stored in
  `cms_page_generation.left_out` and shown in the outcome and the history.
- The SDK (`anthropic-ai/sdk` 0.59) ships `web_search_20260209` and
  `web_search_20260318`, with `allowedDomains`, `blockedDomains`, `maxUses`
  and `userLocation`.

## The mechanism

`web_search` finds pages, not image files. A picture of the web reaches a
page in three steps: search, read the page found for the address of the
picture, import that picture into the media library.

## Steps

1. **Setting.** `generator_web_search` in `GeneratorSettings`, off by default,
   with an optional list of allowed or blocked domains, on the settings
   screen next to `web_fetch`. Off, the request stays byte for byte what it
   was.
2. **The server tool.** Offered in `PageGenerator` when the setting is on,
   `maxUses` 3. `StreamedMessage` handles `server_tool_use` and
   `web_search_tool_result` and sends them back unchanged at the next turn;
   `FakeClaudeTransport` reproduces their shapes.
3. **Reading what was found.** `web_fetch` is offered too when `web_search`
   is, not only when the brief cites an address.
4. **`import_image`, a client tool** (`Generation/Tool/ImportImageTool.php`):
   takes an address, a title and a credit; downloads on the server side,
   `https` only, private and reserved addresses refused, redirects limited,
   type (jpg, png, webp, gif) and size checked; creates the image through the
   code of `Media/Admin/CmsMediaWriter`, tags it for the CMS library, and
   returns its id. The publication then resizes it and serves it as WebP like
   any image of the library.
5. **Ledger.** The searches (queries, count) and the imported images (id,
   source address, credit) recorded with the call, shown in the history like
   the web pages read; the cost of the searches added to the cost of the call.
6. **Skills.** Import only from a source whose terms allow it, credit the
   author in the caption, and say it in `left_out` otherwise.
7. **Tests.** Fake transport for a search, an import that succeeds, imports
   refused (private address, wrong type, too large), and a call where the tool
   is not offered.

## Open questions

1. **Rights on pictures.** An open web search mostly finds pictures nobody may
   reuse. Recommended: restrict `allowedDomains` to free banks (Wikimedia
   Commons, Unsplash, Pexels). Alternative: a dedicated client tool on the
   Unsplash or Pexels API, which returns images with their licence and author
   directly, more reliable than `web_search` for this need, at the price of an
   API key per site.
2. **Cost.** The price of a search is to be confirmed on the current price list
   before it is added to `Generation/Pricing.php`.

## Decisions taken

- A picture of the web is imported into the media library, never linked from
  where it was found: it is resized and served by the site, and it stays when
  the source moves.
- The tool is opt-in per site.
- What the generator could not find goes in `left_out`, never in an invented
  address.

## Resuming

Read, in order: this file, `docs/generator.md` (sections "What the model is
told", "Web pages the brief cites", "The ledger"), `Generation/PageGenerator.php`,
`Generation/StreamedMessage.php`, `Generation/Tool/SearchMediaTool.php`,
`Media/Admin/CmsMediaWriter.php`. Check that the two open questions are
settled, then follow the steps in order, each with its tests.
