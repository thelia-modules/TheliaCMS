/**
 * Receives what a visitor sent and takes them back to the page they were on.
 *
 * Answering with a redirect rather than with a page is what keeps a reload from
 * sending the same message twice — the outcome travels in the session and the
 * page renders it on the way back.
 *
 * There is no CSRF token here, and that is deliberate: the form is public, so
 * the token would be handed to anyone who asks for the page, and it would
 * protect nothing while breaking every cached rendering of it. What actually
 * has to hold is that the submission is not automated, which is what the trap
 * field, the signed stamp and the rate limit are for.
