-- 2.27.0: the SVGs of the media library can be named as icons. `cms_icon` holds
-- the name (without the prefix: `document-valide` is drawn by
-- `cms:document-valide`), one per image and one image per name.
--
-- No foreign key to `library_image`: that table belongs to TheliaLibrary and
-- nothing guarantees it exists when this update runs. A row whose image is gone
-- is ignored when read.
--
-- Written to be replayable: a fresh install runs it after TheliaMain.sql, which
-- already has the table.
