/**
 * The images a piece of published content points at.
 *
 * An export carries no image file. What it carries is the name of each file,
 * and the id it had on the site that wrote it — the two together are enough for
 * the importing site to point the content at its own copy of the same picture,
 * uploaded beforehand through the media library.
 *
 * Content refers to an image through the URL of the image route,
 * `/image-library/{id}/full/{size}/0/default.{format}`, in `src`, in `srcset`
 * and in the CSS of a page. Rewriting is therefore done on the id inside that
 * path, and on nothing else: a bare number in the text of a page is not an
 * image reference.
