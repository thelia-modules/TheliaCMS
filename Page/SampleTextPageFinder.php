/**
 * Pages that are online and still say what the installer wrote in them.
 *
 * The legal pages a site owes its visitors are created as drafts holding
 * instructions, and publishing one has been refused since the guard in
 * CmsPageWriter. That guard came after the sites did: a site installed before it
 * can have those instructions live, in its sitemap and in search results, and
 * nothing anywhere says so. Somebody has to be told, on a screen they open.
 *
 * What it costs. One query that asks the database to look for a single word from
 * each sample sentence in the published pages, returning identifiers only. The
 * pages it names are then read and confirmed with the same check publishing uses,
 * so the answer here and the refusal there can never disagree. On a site of a few
 * hundred pages the first query reads the content table once and the second reads
 * a handful of rows; nothing loads the whole site into memory, which a plain walk
 * over the published pages would.
