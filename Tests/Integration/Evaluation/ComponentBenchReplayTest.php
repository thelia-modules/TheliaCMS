/**

 * through the run command and the oracle, for free: each trial must come to the
 * verdict it was recorded with. The browser measures are replayed as they were
 * taken, the browser not being run here.
 *
 * A recording whose prompt no longer matches the one the generator sends today
 * (a skill, the rules of the generator or a case changed since the round) is
 * stale: its answers still go through the code of today and their verdict is
 * still checked, but it no longer says what the model answers. The stale ones
 * are listed by a test of their own, which reports them without failing.
